# DeepModified
This is a modified version of Deep Voice 3 implementation here https://github.com/Kyubyong/deepvoice3 which is trained on LJ speech dataset.
I have mmodified this model to include basic context and train it on The Simpsons.
The modifications are majorly done in the loading and preprocessing the dataset code.

The model is meant to be trained on audio and dialogues from The Simpsons.
